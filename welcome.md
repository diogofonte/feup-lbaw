Welcome to the documentation pages of the About Fashion system!

You can find here detailed information about the product, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline:

* Requirements Specification
    * [ER Component](aboutfashion/docs/ER.md)
* Database Specification
    * [EBD Component](aboutfashion/docs/EBD.md)
* Architecture Specification and Prototype
    * [EAP Component](aboutfashion/docs/EAP.md)
* Product and Presentation
    * [PA Component](aboutfashion/docs/PA.md)

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

Thank you!
